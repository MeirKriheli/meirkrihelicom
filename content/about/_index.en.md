My name is Meir Kriheli, an experienced freelancer, software developer, system
administrator and open source activist.

Before going solo, I've been a partner at MKsoft systems for 16 years, doing 
software development (backend and frontend), web application development and 
services to organizations, including servers setup, maintenance and consulting.

Development

Worked with various programming languages, tools and database on MS windows and
Linux. These days Python and Linux are my preferred backend language and OS
(respectively). I'm also an experienced frontend developer.

Free Software and Open Source

I use and advocate FLOSS, including Installation, configuration and maintenance
of Linux servers, experience with many distributions and desktop environments.
Been using Linux as my main (and only) OS as far as I can remember.
