    Many Open Source projects start their life as an itch to scratch, but once
    they grow, a little marketing effort can get them to the next stage,
    specially in a crowded niche.

Your project starts as an itch, and you've scratched it. It's growing at
a healthy rate. But wait, while development is the most important aspect
of Open Source and Free Software projects, don't neglect marketing
efforts, small effort can yield quite a gain.

The first stop is the project's web site. A nice looking web site will
keep interested parties, while a neglected one might deter them. In a
crowded niche this might make all the difference.

I'll focus on development languages and tools. Take a look at 
[GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/), 
[Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org/), 
[Lazarus](http://lazarus.freepascal.org/), 
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) web sites:

Mostly are blobs of text, with some news. Lazarus, which is an IDE, has
no single screenshot of the environment in the home page.

When you have a massive following, or backing, like GCC, LLVM and Vim,
it may not present a problem. But Free Pascal and Lazarus web sites are
uninviting, and it's a shame, as they are worthy projects which deserve
a lot more attention than they are getting.

Project leaders may say that they're fine with it, or don't have
resources or backing to invest, but at least allow or delegate to others
who have the will to help. This is important for development languages
and platforms, many developers will bring extra value to such projects
(e.g. bindings to 3rd party libraries).

Now let's compare it to some other projects with inviting web sites,
once again we'll look at some languages and IDEs.

Take a look at the home pages of [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Qt Creator](http://qt.digia.com/Product/Developer-Tools/), 
[NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/), 
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), 
[Go](http://golang.org/) and [Ninja IDE](http://ninja-ide.org/). 
As an added bonus I've included the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) page.

The designs vary, some are flashy, some are clean and simple, yet those
sites do everything that's needed to get you interested, and once
hooked, get started (the Linux kernel page was added as an example of
simplicity).

While some have corporate or financial backing, even a relatively small
project like [Ninja IDE](http://ninja-ide.org/) has a great web site.
IMHO If they can do such a good job, others can follow.

Even a highly popular (and my favorite) platform like [Python](http://www.python.org/)
doesn't take things for granted and invests some resources in 
[web site redesign](http://preview.python.org/) and a great looking 
[Marketing brochure](http://brochure.getpython.info/learn-more) \[Direct link to the preview PDF\].
