I got to know Malcolm via his contributions to Django. Though never met him in
person, I've seen his videos from various DjangoCon and PyCon videos and read
various stuff his written in mailing lists and other venues.

I saw him as a knowledgeable and bright hacker, as well as a great guy and a
nice person. I was saddened to read today 
[he's passed away](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/mar/19/goodbye-malcolm/).

You can find 
[some of his talks at pyvideo.org](http://pyvideo.org/speaker/21/malcolm-tredinnick). 
Here's the talk on Django's ORM implementation:

He will be missed.

RIP Malcolm, thank you for everything.
