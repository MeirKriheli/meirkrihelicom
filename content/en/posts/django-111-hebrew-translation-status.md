After I've missed the deadline for translating Django 1.10, I've started
translating before 
[Django 1.11's plannned release](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-i18n/WMcfYisj_bo/n7G9wLxREgAJ)
on Tuesday, April 4th. This time the Hebrew translation of django-core
was 93%.

As of Saturday, April 1st we're at 100% Hebrew translation for:

*   `django-core`
*   `django-formtools`
*   `django-people`
*   `django-contrib-comments`

Left in the cold, yet again, for lack of time:

*   `django-localflavor`
*   `django-docs`
