summary: >
    It's that time of the year again: Django 1.8's is in string freeze, time to
    brush up the Hebrew translation. Left out for this cycle:
    `django-localflavor` and `django-docs`.

[Django 1.8's string freeze](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-i18n/iaI9t_5vwfE) 
is here, time to update the Hebrew translation as django-core was on 93%

Standing at 100% translation after a couple of days:

*   django-core
*   [django-formtools](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/formtools/#formtools-how-to-migrate) - Removed from django.contrib
*   django-people ([the website](https://people.djangoproject.com/))

Left in the cold for lack of time:

*   django-localflavor - couldn't find Hebrew names for many of the cities (stands at 46%).
*   django-docs - A **lot** to translate (stands at 1%).
