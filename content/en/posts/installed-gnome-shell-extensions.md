Since it's first release, Gnome shell has become one of my favorite and most
used desktop environment.

No DE is perfect, but luckily we have
[extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) to customize it to our needs. Here
are some of the installed extensions which make my life better.

## Advanced Calculator

[Advanced calculator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/121/gcalcsearch/)
is a search provider for the overview, enabling typing calculations into the
search field and displaying the result in the search results. Clicking the
result will copy it to the clipboard.

## Frippery Shut Down Menu

"Hibernate" to the Power Off dialog.

## Maximus

Thunderbird alerts, etc).

## Panel Settings

location (top, bottom) from the user menu.

## Remove Accessibility

[Remove the accessibility button](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/112/remove-accesibility/)
