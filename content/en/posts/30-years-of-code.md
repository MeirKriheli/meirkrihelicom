    I got my 1st computer at the age of 13, been programming since then. My last
    birthday marked 30 years of code.

The first computer I've got at the time for my upcoming 
[Bar Mitzvah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_Bat_Mitzvah) was the
[Commodore VIC-20](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_20) followed later
by it's Datasette for external storage.

Unlike today, the computer came with a programming book and I've been
hooked from day one. Been programming since: during my high school,
practical engineer studies, army service and as a freelancer.

30 years with many hardware platforms and operating systems (OS/2 was my
favorite at the time) have come and gone. Programmed with too many
languages and paradigms to remember. System administration intertwined
naturally (Novel Netware, Windows, Linux).

Today my usual weapons of choice are Python, Linux and FLOSS in general.
Considering all this time, scale and technologies - the nagging feeling
at the back of my head is still going strong:

I feel old :-(
