After some burnout hiatus, with [Django 2.2 at RC1](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/eR9H7bwhVS4/Nxb7vYq4CgAJ),
I'm back translating Django to Hebrew.

As of Tuesday, March 19th, the Hebrew translation is at 100% for:

* `django-core`
* `django-formtools`
* `django-people`
* `django-contrib-comments`

Left in the cold, yet again, for lack of time:

* `django-localflavor`
* `django-docs`
* `djangoproject.com` (new)
