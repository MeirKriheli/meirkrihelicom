This website was generated with
[a custom static generator](https://github.com/MeirKriheli/statirator/) based on
Django, using [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) for
posts markup. Maintenance has become a burden, and I've lacked the energy for it.

The site was converted to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - utilizing 
[Markdown](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#learn-markdown) for the 
content. Care was taken preserving the old URLs and comments.

The conversion process involved [Adding right-to-left support to Ananke theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke/pull/532/commits)
and [Hebrew translation](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke/pull/544).
