[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) with
[tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) and
[vim](http://www.vim.org/) are an integral part of my workflow.

As a freelance I work with multiple projects written in different
languages and require different services (db, cache, etc). This setup
enables starting the different services and switching between project
quickly.

Although at work it's a different story, a single project, The setup
above is still useful, as it makes starting the dev environment (on a
different machine) and re-attaching to it fairly simple.

[PyWeb-IL 40](http://whatsup.org.il/article/7194) meeting are available at the
