A couple of months ago I've wrote about [missing RTL support for the new
Disqus](/en/2013/07/disqus-and-rtl-no-dice/).

**Disqus implemented RTL support since then**, there were several small
issues, like breaking the layout on mobile devices, but they're fixed.
Kudos to Disqus' team!

However, one little nagging Hebrew translation issue remains, surely I'm
not the only one complaining about (it was [mentioned in the
comments](/2013/07/disqus-and-rtl-no-dice/#comment-979409743) to the
Hebrew version of the original post):

The [Hebrew translation for \`reply\`](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/disqus/translate/#he/js/10427274)
is translated as _quote_ which is wrong. That translation is marked as
reviewed at Transifex, so I can't change nor suggest a new one. That's
true for other translation mentioning reply, like in reply to is
translated as quoted for.

I've left an open issue on Transfiex 13 days ago, hopefully it'll be
resolved soon.
