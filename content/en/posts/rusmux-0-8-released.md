Just released [rusmux 0.8](https://github.com/MeirKriheli/rusmux/releases/tag/v0.8.0),
which includes:

* A new feature to set `root` option per window, overriding `project_root`.
* Updated dependencies (which affects MSRV).

[Rusmux is a `tmuxinator` replacement I've written in `Rust`]({{<ref "introducing-rusmux">}}),
to automate tmux sessions.
