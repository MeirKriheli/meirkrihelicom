I've started translating late into 
[Django 1.9's string freeze](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-i18n/1.9/django-i18n/xPz7mfakZA4/xcNDlIlYAwAJ),
this time the Hebrew translation of django-core was 95%.

Hopefully I didn't miss the deadline for 
[1.9's translations merge](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-i18n/xPz7mfakZA4/H30rk8rSAwAJ).
As of Saturday, Novemeber 25th the we're at 100% Hebrew translation for:

*   django-core
*   [django-formtools](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/formtools/#formtools-how-to-migrate)
    - Removed from django.contrib
*   django-people ([the website](https://people.djangoproject.com/))
*   [django-contrib-comments](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-contrib-comments)

Left in the cold, yet again, for lack of time:

*   django-localflavor
*   django-docs
