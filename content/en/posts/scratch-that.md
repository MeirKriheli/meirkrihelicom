My 8 year daughter, Tzlil, is participating in after school activities
for outstanding students here in
[Netanya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netanya).

One evening, she came back wishing to show off her work. She popped the
thumb drive into the computer, tried to open the file, and got nothing.

I'm a Linux user - all the computers in our house are running some
distro of it. Being accustomed to the nation's education system and
their proprietary slant, I was ready to rally the troops and storm the
poor, unsuspecting, instructors.

After calming down, we've talked and she mentioned the software name,
[Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/). The name rang a bell, searching
whatsup.org.il verified it: I've written in the past an article about
[kids related software](http://whatsup.org.il/article/6679) (in Hebrew).

Quick search on her computer (well not so quick, yum, aaargh) showed
that Scratch was available in Fedora 19's repos. Installed it and all is
well.

Kudos to the instructors for using cross-platform and open-source (with
some limits) software. War averted and peace restored upon the land.
Until the next time ....
