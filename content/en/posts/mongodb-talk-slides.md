[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is a document oriented, scalable,
high-performance, open source database written in C++.

I gave a talk about it and it's usage with Perl during
[Perl Mongers Tel-Aviv](http://telaviv.pm.org/previous.html#meeting_oct_31_2012) 
meeting at October 2012.

[Slides about MongoDB](/en/talks/#mongodb) are available at the
[Talks and presentations](/en/talks/) page.
