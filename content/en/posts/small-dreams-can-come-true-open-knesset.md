Working for an open source project/company was a small dream of mine for a long
time.

[Open Knesset](http://www.oknesset.org/) is an open source project (BSD
licensed) which exposes the activity of the
[Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset) and it's members to the
public. I've been a volunteer in that project for some time (less in the last
couple of months as load was increasing).

Recently the project got some funding and published a
[job offer](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/open-knesset/gyf1LGbZbm0/discussion)
for a developer to:

*   Create a better setup for new developers
*   Improve performance and stability
*   Complete the APIs
*   Improve and write documentation
*   Handle pull requests and the developers community
*   Cleanup the [bug tracker](https://track.nsa.co.il/projects/oknesset/issues)
*   Add features

I've applied, and a small dream came true: Starting Dec 2012, I'll be working
for Open Knesset for 5 months. They were generous enough to meet me half way
with the salary - thank you !

The project is based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). We meet every
Monday evening at URU office in Tel-Aviv. If you know Django/Python or want to
learn hands on, you're a designer or can contribute in other ways (it's a
meeting place for non-developers as well), please join us at the meetings and
subscribe to the [general group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-knesset) 
and [developers group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oknesset-dev).
