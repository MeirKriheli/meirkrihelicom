    Talk regarding Sphinx document generator which I gave at PyWeb-IL 34
    Perl Mongers Tel-Aviv meeting at 03/2012.
draft: true

Sphinx_ is an extensible document generator written in Python and uses
reStructuredText_ as it's markup language. It creates intelligent and beautiful
documentation, and has support for documenting several programming languages,
different output formats, cross-references, Hierarchical structure, Automatic
indices and Syntax Highlighting.

I gave a talk about it at `PyWeb-IL 34`_ and (with some modifications) at
`Perl Mongers Tel-Aviv`_ meeting at 03/2012.

The `slides about Sphinx`_ available at the `Talks and presentations`_ page.
