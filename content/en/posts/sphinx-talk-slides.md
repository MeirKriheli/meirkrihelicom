    Talk regarding Sphinx document generator which I gave at PyWeb-IL 34
    Perl Mongers Tel-Aviv meeting at 03/2012.
---

[Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) is an extensible document generator written
in Python and uses [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html) as it's
markup language. It creates intelligent and beautiful documentation, and has
support for documenting several programming languages, different output formats,
cross-references, Hierarchical structure, Automatic indices and Syntax
Highlighting.

I gave a talk about it at [PyWeb-IL 34](http://whatsup.org.il/article/6973) and
(with some modifications) at [Perl Mongers Tel-Aviv](http://telaviv.pm.org/previous.html#meeting_mar_28_2012)
meeting at 03/2012.
